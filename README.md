Project Title: Responsive Web Design with Vanilla HTML and CSS

Project Description:

In this project, our goal is to design and develop a responsive website consisting of 3-5 pages, including the landing page. The client has specifically requested the use of only vanilla HTML and CSS,
limiting the technology stack to these fundamental web development languages.

Client Requirements:

 *Responsive Design: The website must be accessible and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes. Employ CSS media queries to ensure responsiveness.

* Pages Structure: Create a cohesive structure with a landing page and 2-4 additional pages. These pages should maintain a consistent design theme.
  
* Navigation: Implement a navigation menu that is easy to use and provides seamless navigation between pages. Consider incorporating CSS styling for visual feedback on hover or click.
  
* Styling and Layout: Design the website with clean and intuitive styling using only HTML and CSS. Utilize CSS for layout, ensuring a balanced and visually pleasing presentation of content.
  
* Client's Creative Freedom: The client is relying on our creative expertise to choose the content for the website. This means selecting appropriate text,
 images, and other media elements to convey a cohesive and engaging narrative.

This project challenges our creativity and expertise in crafting a visually appealing and functional website using only the fundamental building blocks of web development â€“ HTML and CSS.
By following the client's requirements and employing best practices, we aim to deliver a website that meets both aesthetic and functional expectations.
